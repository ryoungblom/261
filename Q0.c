    /* ANSWER:  The value of X has been changed/increased despite the incrementation taking place inside of a function because
     a pointer was passed to the function.  If the variable x had been passed, it only would have incremented within fooA(), but
     a pointer actually access the address where the value is stored.  Therefore, when a pointer (or, more accurately, the
     variable stored at an address that a pointer points to) is accessed, it actually changed the value globally. When the pointer
     to x was incremented inside fooA(), it actually changed the integer that was stored at the address of x. */

    /*Print the value and address of x*/

    printf("Back in Main, the address of x is : %p\n", &x);
    
    /* ANSWER: The address of x is the same as it was before the call to fooB().  This is, again, due to the nature of pointers. When
     sending in the address of x, you're sending a pointer to an address, which is really just a variable that holds an address
     value.  As we can see from fooA(), this variable even has its own address. So by changing the "value" of the pointer  variable
     inside a function, it's just like changing the value of any other variable inside a functionâ€”it's a local change that does not
     persist outside of the function. Therefore, when we're back in Main, the address, despite being decremented inside of a
     function, is restored back to its original value (which, in this case, is the original address). */
